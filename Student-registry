# 📚 Student Registry Exercise

This is a simple Python exercise for practicing **lists, dictionaries, and string formatting**.

---

## 📌 Description
The program stores information about students in a list of dictionaries.  
Each student has:
- name  
- birth year  
- address  
- grades in several subjects  

---

## 🎯 Tasks
1. Ask the user to type a student's name (full name or part of it).  
2. Print all the student's information in a formatted sentence.  
3. If no match is found, display **"Student not found."**  

✅ Note: The program uses modern Python **f-strings** for printing.

## 🐍 Example Solution

```python
students = [
    {"name": "John Smith", "birth_year": 2005, "address": "12 Green St",
     "grades": {"Math": 85, "English": 90, "Physics": 78}},
    {"name": "Emily Johnson", "birth_year": 2006, "address": "34 Blue Rd",
     "grades": {"Math": 92, "English": 88, "Physics": 95}},
    {"name": "Michael Brown", "birth_year": 2004, "address": "56 Red Ave",
     "grades": {"Math": 70, "English": 65, "Physics": 72}}
]

student_name = input("Choose a Student: ")

def information(name):
    name = name.lower().strip()
    for s in students:
        if name in s["name"].lower():
            print(
                f"Student {s['name']} was born in year {s['birth_year']}, "
                f"lives at {s['address']}, and his grades are: "
                f"Math {s['grades']['Math']}, English {s['grades']['English']} "
                f"and Physics {s['grades']['Physics']}."
            )
            return
    print(f"Student with name '{name}' was not found.")
