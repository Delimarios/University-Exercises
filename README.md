# 🎓 School Exercises Repository

Welcome to my collection of programming exercises!  
Here I upload my practice code from school, online courses, and random experiments.  
It’s my personal **playground** for learning and improving step by step. 🚀  

## 📂 What’s inside
- **python/** → This repository mainly contains Python exercises, covering everything from the basics of programming and algorithms to data structures, recursion, sorting/searching methods, file handling, and small creative projects like simple games.

## 💡 Why this repo?
Not every project has to be huge – even small exercises show how I learn and grow.  
This is where I keep track of my progress and share my coding journey.  

Stay tuned: from “Hello World” → to bigger projects! ✨
